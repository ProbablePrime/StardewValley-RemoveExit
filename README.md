# StardewValley RemoveExit
A Stardew Valley [SMAPI](https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI) mod that prevents the user from exiting the game. 

# Why?

I'm a 3rd party [Beam](https://beam.pro) Interactive integration developer. I run events like TwitchPlaysPokemon but for StardewValley.
I don't want the players to exit the game especially seeing as they have direct control over the host machines mouse.
